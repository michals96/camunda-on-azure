# An Azure platform for quick Camunda enablement

# Title of Post
Start your post with a brief hook. Be conversational and personal - maybe use a brief story to
draw the reader in.
End your introduction with a simple statement that explains the problem you want to solve and a
brief one or two-sentence summary of how you’re going to solve the problem.

## Introductory Paragraph
The body of your post provides the substance that supports your main idea or explains the
solution you found to the problem you’ve established above.
Try to include screenshots, code snippets, and gifs to illustrate the steps that you’re taking along
the way.


## Concept Building Paragraph
This is where you'll build on the topic you introduced in your lede and introduction. It's an
opportunity to dig deeper into the concept you outlined. This can include going into more detail
about:
* Your use case, including how Camunda and/or process automation has helped your
  organization
* An interesting customer success story made possible with process automation
* How you solved a problem or challenge you were facing
* Why you chose a particular technology, built a specific project, or worked on a piece of
  software
* How you applied what you learned in your introduction

## (Optional) Further Exploration Paragraph
Here's where you can dig into complex topics, back up a customer use case story with
interesting data, or really show off some in-depth code or a technical process. This paragraph is
also an opportunity to explore how you implemented any solutions you outlined above and what
steps you plan to take in the future

## Conclusion
Let the reader know they’ve made it to the end. Finish your post with a brief restatement of your
main point. Tell the reader you hope they found your post helpful and encourage them to get
started with your idea.

## Key Takeaways and CTAs
Here's where you can highlight the top 3-4 key takeaways a reader can bring back to their
organization after having read your article. These are high-level, one-sentence summaries of
each of your paragraphs. For example:
* Here's how you implement process automation
* Why our organization chose Camunda
* Relying on data is important
* In the end, automation = success
